# Week 1 Progress – AICTE Internship 

This week marks the start of my internship journey, and I’ve made some solid progress on my project titled:

### Real-Time Garbage Detection Using Deep Learning

The idea is to build a system that can classify different types of garbage from video or CCTV input using AI — making waste sorting more efficient and eco-friendly. ♻

## What I accomplished this week:

- Finalized the project idea after exploring different options that are socially useful and technically feasible.
- Downloaded a public garbage image dataset with six categories:  
  `cardboard`, `glass`, `metal`, `paper`, `plastic`, and `trash`.
- Organized the dataset into folders for each class and got a feel for the data.
- Set up Google Colab with GPU support (since Jupyter had issues on my system).
- Learned how to upload and extract datasets in Colab using zip files.
- Preprocessed the dataset with TensorFlow’s `image_dataset_from_directory()` function and split it into training and validation sets.
- Began building my image classification model using EfficientNetV2B0 with transfer learning — it's exciting to see it coming together!
