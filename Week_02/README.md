In Week 2 of the AICTE internship, I focused on utilizing the trained model from Week 1 (garbage_model.h5) to perform real-time garbage detection. The model was loaded into a new notebook, and predictions were tested on individual image files representing various types of waste materials.

Tasks Completed
- Loaded the trained `.h5` model into a new Google Colab notebook
- Defined class labels based on the dataset used in Week 1
- Built a function to make predictions from uploaded images
- Tested the model using sample garbage images
- Observed and documented model predictions for analysis
